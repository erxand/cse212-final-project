# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial. Every programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked-lists.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain desctriptions of structure, how basic functions work, and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
