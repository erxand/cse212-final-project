# Trees
A tree is used as a way to store data. They are very organized and because of that they are very fast to search. Trees will probably be the hardest data structure in this tutorial to understand, but if you already understood the linked list you will have an easier time learning trees.

## Structure
A binary tree is essentially a two-dimensional upgraded linked list, instead of the head pointing to one value it points to two. Each value thereafter also points to two values, unless there isn't a value available for that spot.
