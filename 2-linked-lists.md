# Linked Lists
If you already have an idea of how a list or array works then you shouldn't have a hard time understanding linked lists. A linked list is essentially a unique way to create a list, it has some drawbacks but definitely has some uses. Blockchain technology is a great example of a very advanced linked list.

## Structure
You might think that you don't know what a stanchion is, but you would be wrong. You've seen them before, you've probably spent more time around them than you would've liked to. You know those wait-high crowd control pole things in airports and other places to help form lines? They have the stretchy fabric divider that stretches between each pole? Those are stanchions. Stanchions are actually a great example of linked lists.

## Basic Functions
| Stack Operation | Description | Python Code | O(?) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| insert_head(x) | Adds _x_ before the head, it becomes the new head | linked_list.appendleft(x) | O(1) |
| insert_tail(x) | Adds _x_ after the tail, it becomes the new tail | linked_list.append(x) | O(1) |
| insert(i, x) | Adds _x_ after node _i_. | my_deque.insert(i, x) | O(n) |
| remove_head() | Removes the head (the first item) | x = linked_list.popleft() | O(1) |
| remove_tail() | Removes the tail (the last item) | x = linked_list.pop() | O(1) |
| remove(i) | Removes node _i_. | del linked_list[i] | O(n) |
| size() | Return the size of the linked list | length = len(linked_list) | O(1) |
| empty() | Returns true if the length of the linked list is zero. | if len(linked_list) == 0: | O(1) |

## Example: Stanchion


## Problem: Geocaching Activity
this may be problematic
